# DS PDF Viewer

## What is dspdfviewer?
dspdfviewer is a pre-rendering and caching (read: *fast*) full-screen pdf
viewer specifically designed for latex-beamer presentations,
that were created with the `show notes on second screen=right` option.

It will take your double-width PDF file, split it in half, render the
left half to the audience (via a beamer) and the right half - which will
contain the notes you entered in your LaTeX source - on your laptop screen.

In addition, your laptop screen will contain some counters and a wall-clock,
which may help you time your presentation right.

Both screens will be rendered and scaled completely independent of each other,
so you can use two screens with different resolutions and/or aspect ratios.

## How do I use it?

Please read the program's manual page for usage instructions. If you have
dspdfviewer installed, the correct version should be available
as `man dspdfviewer`. In addition, you can [read the manual online].
