How to install the dspdfviewer


1. Debian-based distributions
=============================


1.1 Install ready-to-run binaries
---------------------------------
If you use debian wheezy, you might want to use my public repository under

http://danny-edel.de/deb

Instructions on how to use it are inside.


1.2 Compile it yourself
-----------------------
You're in luck. Its really easy. First, you want to install the "devscripts"
package for debuild and debi:

su -c "apt-get install devscripts"

To build the software - assuming you're in the base directory - just
execute the following commands:

debuild -tc # If it complains about missing build-deps, use apt-get install...
su -c debi # Ubuntu guys try "sudo debi" instead

2. Gentoo
=========

1. Install from ebuild
----------------------

Two kinds of ebuilds are available for dspdfviewer: the git ebuild
(with version number 9999), which downloads and installs the latest
git version of dspdfviewer, and regular ebuilds with normal version
numbers.

To install, move the ebuilds in the "gentoo" subdirectory into an
overlay (for more information on overlays, see [the gentoo manual][1])
in the "app-text/dspdfviewer" directory. Then, unmask the version you
want and run "emerge dspdfviewer".

3. Other distributions
======================

Since I use cmake as a build system, the following sequence should compile it.

mkdir /tmp/builddir
cd /tmp/builddir
cmake /path/to/the/downloaded/dspdfviewer-source
make && make install
