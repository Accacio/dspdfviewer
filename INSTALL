How to install the dspdfviewer


1. Debian-based distributions
=============================
 

1.1 Install ready-to-run binaries
---------------------------------
If you use debian wheezy, you might want to use my public repository under

http://danny-edel.de/deb

Instructions on how to use it are inside.


1.2 Compile it yourself
-----------------------
You're in luck. Its really easy. Assuming you're in the base directory, just
execute the following commands:

debuild -tc # If it complains about missing build-deps, use apt-get install...
su -c debi # Ubuntu guys try "sudo debi" instead


2. Other distributions
======================

Since I use cmake as a build system, the following sequence should compile it.

mkdir /tmp/builddir
cd /tmp/builddir
cmake /path/to/the/downloaded/dspdfviewer-source
make && make install
