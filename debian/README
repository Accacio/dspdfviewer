Debian directory in dspdfviewer's git-repository
------------------------------------------------

This debian/ directory is here to create automatic builds from every
git revision on travis, jenkins and launchpad's auto-build service.

As such, the program pretends to be debian-native, so that travis,
jenkins and users can simply call debuild to generate tarball
and a working binary on-the-fly.

The created packages will likely be of subpar quality and are meant for
users that want to test new and unreleased features without having
too much hassle.


A proper debian package has already been included into debian sid
and is maintained by me.  You can browse the repository at
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/dspdfviewer.git or clone
from git://anonscm.debian.org/collab-maint/dspdfviewer.git
