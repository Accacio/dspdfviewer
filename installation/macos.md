## Homebrew
If you use a mac with Homebrew, there already is a formula to install
dspdfviewer

{% highlight bash %}
brew install dspdfviewer
{% endhighlight %}

The previous command installs the latest release. If you want to test out the
newest features, provide the head option:

{% highlight bash %}
brew install dspdfviewer --HEAD
{% endhighlight %}
